You will set up Heroku to run on a production, not development, version of your application.
When a Node.js application like yours is pushed up to Heroku, it is identified as a Node.js application because of the package.json file.
 It runs npm install automatically.
  Then, if there is a heroku-postbuild script in the package.json file, it will run that script.
  Afterwards, it will automatically run npm start.
